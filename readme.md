Weather is a project that tracks weather forecasts made by three independent weather services over a long time to verify the accuracy of the 5-day, 7-day and 14-day weather prediction. The project follows maximum and minimum temperatures, probability of precipitation and compares the forecasts to what actually happens for each day.
The goal of the project is to publish the results as widely as possible and hopefully promote a sense of accountability for those who actually produce these forecasts. To date forecasts from the Weather Network, Environment Canada and the National Post newspaper for the City of Toronto are being tracked, but others can easily be added.
